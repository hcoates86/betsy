            <p>At Betsy, we're dedicated to helping the average farmer (that's you) find the cow they're looking for.
                Or, if you're looking to unload some extra cattle, find the right home for them. We host sales for everything from
                dairy cows, to those intended for the dinner table, to whatever you might need a cow for. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So get on over there and buy yourself a cow.
